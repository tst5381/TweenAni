# TweenAni
#### A DOTween extension for data-driven usage for Unity 2018.
The funtionality is similar to DOTween Pro, but it's much simpler, designed to feed my own needs.

As dependency DOTween v1.2.420 has been included in this repository, if your project already has one then delete the DOTween folder.

## Feature
- Setup a sequence via Unity inspector
- Drag and drop to reorder tweener items
- Play Mode buttons for quick testing when fine-tuning
- Follow: Insert a tweener at the end of the previous tweener
- Easily extensible code architecture
